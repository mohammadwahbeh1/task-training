  "content": "Web hosting is like renting space on the internet for your website. It means storing your website's files on special computers called servers, so people can visit your site. When someone types your website address, the hosting service sends them your site's content. There are different kinds of hosting, like shared hosting (sharing a server with others) or dedicated hosting (having a server all to yourself). Hosting companies often offer other services too, like email, domain names, and security certificates. Choosing the right hosting is important for how well your website works."
